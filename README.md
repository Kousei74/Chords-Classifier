# Chords Classifier

This project focuses on audio-sample analysis, offering a comprehensive solution for music enthusiasts and researchers. The classifier employs Matplotlib for frequency-based data visualization, utilizes data cleaning and pre-processing techniques, and employs cross-validation to select the most effective machine learning model.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure your audio samples are in a compatible format.
   - Update the file paths in the designated section for seamless data loading.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Leverage Matplotlib plots to gain insights into the frequency-based domain of the audio data.
   - Use Pandas for creating the dataframe.

3. **Data Processing:**
   - Apply data cleaning and pre-processing steps for optimal feature extraction (for more details on the procedure, refer to code).

4. **Model Selection:**
   - Perform cross-validation score checks and identify the best-performing machine learning model.

5. **Chord Classification:**
   - Implement the chosen model to classify chords in audio samples.
